## <ins>About GetHarvest</ins>

### Harvest first began in 2006 as a tool two designers built for themselves to help their business grow. At a small web design agency in downtown New York City, Danny Wen and Shawn Liu made the tool they couldnâ€™t find: a well-designed, innovative application to track time and invoice. They built Harvest.

### Today, Harvest serves the time tracking and billing needs of thousands of customers around the world.
